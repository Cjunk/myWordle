# Wordle
General Assembly project Wordle Game

### By Jericho Sharman

### **DESCRIPTION**
Wordle is an word game bearing some resemblance to popular code-breaking, colour-coded board games like Mastermind, but is even more simple in its design.

Every new game brings a new, mystery five letter word to guess – which must be done through entering five letter words onto Wordle’s tile grid.

The first attempt will see any tiles containing the correct letter change colour to either yellow, green or grey, prompting users to make further guesses with words containing more of the correct or partially letters to be found in the ‘Wordle’.

### **INSTRUCTIONS**
Guesses at the ‘Wordle’ to be five letters in length and must be a valid word in the word list

Once you’ve entered your first five letter word, hit the enter button to submit.
You will then see each letter on its tile turn to either grey, yellow or green.

+ GREEN:  The letter is correct and in the correct location
+ YELLOW: The letter is in the word however in the wrong location
+ GREY: The letter is not contained in the mystery word.

### **TIPS**
The biggest challenge when it comes to playing Wordle is often deciding which five letter word you are going to try first.

The seed word you choose can either set you on the course for victory or plunge you into a cycle of despair should it not contain any of the letters included in each day’s Wordle.

### **SCORING**
The game will keep track of your winning streaks. Try to get the highest streak!!
